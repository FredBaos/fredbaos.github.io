# Introduction

This project aims to explore how people consume goods and what might influence the purchase. For that, The Complete Journey dataset from Dunnhumby was used). It provides various information about transactions from 2,500 households at a retailer over two years (content of their baskets, use of coupons, householdâ€™s information, etc.).
Having access to these information offers interesting perspectives, such as :
-	Which goods are the most purchased and which are less ?
-	What goods are frequently or rarely bought together ?
-	Do the income and the number of children have an influence on the purchases ?
